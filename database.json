Combine well without over-mixing.\nShape the Patties:\n\nDivide the mixture into 4 equal portions and shape into patties about 1/2 inch thick. Make a small indent in the center to prevent puffing during cooking.\nCook the Patties:\n\nHeat a grill or frying pan over medium-high heat. Cook patties for about 3-4 minutes on each side, or until desired doneness. Add cheese slices during the last minute of cooking if desired.\nToast the Buns:\n\nLightly toast the burger buns on the grill or in a skillet for extra flavor.\nAssemble the Burgers:\n\nSpread condiments (ketchup, mayonnaise, mustard) on the buns. Add lettuce, tomato slices, onion rings, and pickles. Place the cooked patty on top, cover with the bun, and serve.",
